Demo for how to generate seed plans for GerryChain.
* `seed_plans_demo.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that walks through how to use `recursive_seed_part` and some other methods to generate seed plans.
* `seed_plans_examples.pdf` walks through three visual examples of how `recursive_seed_part` generates a seed plan, given different parameters.
* `seed_plans_iterative_bipartition.py` is a script by Amy Becker used to generate seed plans by running targeted chains (examples are in the demo).
